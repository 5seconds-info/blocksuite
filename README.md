# Building Blocks

Building Blocks framework workspace

## Development

Setting up basic local environment:

```bash
# install dependencies
pnpm i

# start vite playground
pnpm dev
```

To test locally, please make sure browser binaries are already installed via `npx playwright install` and Vite playground is started with `pnpm dev`. Then there are multi commands to choose from:

```bash
# run tests in headless mode in in another terminal window
pnpm test

# or run tests in headed mode for debugging
pnpm test:headed
```

In headed mode, `await page.pause()` can be used in test cases to suspend the test runner.
